# House-Price-Predictor
House Price Predictor is a Machine Learning project that predicts house prices based on key features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other property attributes. The model uses data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression algorithms to provide accurate price estimates. This project demonstrates end-to-end ML workflow including data analysis, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

### Dataset Source - Bengaluru House price data(KAGGLE)
The dataset contains housing data from Bangalore, including features such as location, total square footage, number of bedrooms (BHK), number of bathrooms, and price. It is used to analyze real estate trends and train a machine learning model to predict house prices based on property characteristics. The dataset requires preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
